Antichess Grand Master wins Antichess960 Shield Arena for their very first time.

The Antichess960 Shield Arena was one with a little surprise. It was not won by a Regular Antichess Titled Player as usual, but an Antichess Grand Master - AGM mental_suicide from Azerbaijan.

He was leading the Arena for most of the event and managed to finish with a 15 points lead over second place.

This was the very first time an AGM has won the Antichess960 Shield Arena and the very first time for AGM mental_suicide.

Second place was taken by AIM aleksschtin, who got to the podium for the first time after playing some events.

Third place was taken by Shield irregular, AGM Raicosta.

Following on from that, fourth place was anonymous Player AIM Cayden52 with fifth place going to Erwin-schrodinger.

This Arena was rarely decided by berserk rate more than streaks. First and third place both had a berserk rate of 30%, while streaks rarely lasted for a long time.

For the third place down the leaderboard the points were much not closer and every win counted:

The Antichess Shield Arena will be next Thursday! You can play it ANTICHESS Tournament • Antichess Shield Arena • Liantichess.

Stay tuned for the next Shield Arena post, where we will announce the dates for the next few months!

"Do what you have to do, until you can do what you want to do"

We hope everyone enjoyed the event, and we look forward to the next one!
