# NM Deadnotforgotten wins Losers Shield Arena for their very first time.

## The Losers Shield Arena was one with a little surprise. 

## It was not won by a Antichess Titled Player as usual, but an National Master - NM Deadnotforgotten from Cuba.

## He was leading the Arena for most of the event and managed to finish with a 6 point lead over second place.

## This was the very first time an NM has won the Losers Shield Arena and the very first time for NM Deadnotforgotten.

## Second place was taken by Erwin-schrodinger, who got to the podium for the first time after playing some events. Third place was taken by Shield irregular, Linora.

## Following on from that, fourth place was anonymous Player Mi5ter_t with fifth place going to Antichessdeamon13.

## This Arena was decided by berserk rate more than streaks. First and third place both had a berserk rate of 48%, while streaks rarely lasted for a long time.

## For the third place down the leaderboard the points were much not closer and every win counted:

## The Antichess960 Shield Arena will be tomorrow! You can play it ANTICHESS Tournament • Antichess960 Shield Arena • Liantichess. 

## Stay tuned for the next Shield Arena post, where we will announce the dates for the next few months!
